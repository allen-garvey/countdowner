#Countdowner

Countdowner is a native Mac OSX status bar application that shows you just how fast your life is slipping away. It displays the days, hours, minutes, and seconds until your chosen deadline, or displays a custom message when your deadline is past.

##Installing

1. Download the Countdowner project files.

2. Compile the project by opening it in Xcode (free download from the Appstore required) and going to Product->Archive->Export.

3. If you see an Î© symbol in your status bar (upper right hand corner of your screen), Countdowner is running. You can configure it by clicking on the icon.

##Technical Specifications
